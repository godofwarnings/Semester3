2. https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/r17zja/whats_the_difference_between_calculus_and_real/

In essence, real analysis is where you rigorously prove the concepts and theorems that are used in calculus. In calculus, you just apply theses concepts nd theorems without really worrying about proving where they come from.
