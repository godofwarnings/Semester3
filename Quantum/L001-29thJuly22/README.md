# Lecture 1 - 29th July 2022

### Outline of the class

> Nothing was discussed in great detail. These are just the ideas that sir shared.
- Basic intro to why quantum mechanics was born which we cover at +2 level
- Blackbody radiation and Photoelectric effect are explained by particle nature of light
- Discrete problem and Continnum problem
- Wave has mass. How to make sense of this statement?
- The collapsing electron problem
- Pauli exclusion principle and its effect on Chemical Binding (how it prevents electrons from collapsing into the nucleus)
- Fermi pressure
- Chandrasekhar limit
- Wavelength of light and how it relates to precision of measurement
- Double slit experiment
- When we observe something, the thing resolves from the "unknown state" to a fixed state. Like a qubit. A qubit has some probability of having value 0 and some probability of having value 1 but when we measure/read the qubit, it resolves into a single value.
